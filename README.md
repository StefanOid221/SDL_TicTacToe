# SDL_TicTacToe

This is a simple TicTacToe game that can be played locally by two players. What I've learned from this project can be sumarized as follows:

1- How networking works with SDL2 and SDLNet, without entering in more complex connections. Just connecting locally was enough for me for the time being.

2- I've started to use reference and pointers on my own, and learning from the segmentation errors of not correctly defining them or initializing them.

3- I've managed to learn how to setup the debugger for VS Code, a very important tool that I will use a lot.


In order to play the game:

1- Execute the server.exe and minimize the console.

2- Execute two times the client.exe, the first window open will be the Player 1.
